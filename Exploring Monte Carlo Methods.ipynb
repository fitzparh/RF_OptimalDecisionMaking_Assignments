    "## Monte Carlo \n",
    "\n",
    "Very often when solving Reinforcement problems, we don't have complete knowledge of our environment and the transistion states. In such cases, we can turn to Monte Carlo methods. The term 'Monte Carlo' usually refers to any alogorithm that involves a significant random component. In the context of Reinforcement Learning, the random component is the return. With Monte Carlo (MC) methods, instead of calculating the true expected value which requires knowing the real probability distributions, MC uses the sample mean and calculates the average of returns.  In order for this to work, we need to assume we are doing episodic tasks only - the episode must terminate before we can calculate returns. In comparison to previously explored techniques e.g. Policy iteration, we don't update the value function after every action, rather we do it at the end of every episode. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Generate G (sample returns)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get sampled returns, we need play a bunch of episodes and calculate the returns for each episode. From the rewards, we can calculate the returns which is the sum of all future rewards. When implementing this code, it's useful to loop through the states and rewards in reverse order since G depends only on future values. Once we've done this for multiple episodes, we'll have multiple lists of S's and G's and then we can take the sample mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### First-visit method\n",
    "\n",
    "In the circumstance that we see the same state more than once in an episode and we don't know which return we should use, we can use the first-visit method. This method basically stipulates that we only include a return if it is the first time we've seen this state in this episode. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculating the sample mean\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not computationally efficient to store ALL returns in a list. Instead we can use the previous mean to calculate current mean.\n",
